# comm-openbox

**comm-openbox** is a **CommunityBig** metapackage that provides a fully configured and ready-to-use **Openbox** environment.

**Openbox** is a highly configurable, ultra-lightweight window manager ‚Äî not a full desktop environment ‚Äî built for speed and simplicity. It's especially well-suited for older or low-spec computers, as it consumes very few system resources while remaining fast, flexible, and visually elegant when properly themed.

This package is ideal for users who want a smooth, responsive, and visually appealing desktop experience without compromising performance ‚Äî particularly on modest hardware.

> üé® This project was **inspired by the excellent work of [Archcraft](https://github.com/archcraft-os/archcraft-openbox)**, adapted and enhanced for the CommunityBig/Manjaro ecosystem.
